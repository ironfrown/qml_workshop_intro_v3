- **Associated with:** [QPoland](https://qworld.net/qpoland/) and [Quantum AI Foundation](https://www.qaif.org/)
- **Aims:** To explore the creation and use of quantum machine learning models in PennyLane (PL) and PyTorch.
- **Description:** This Quantum Machine Learning (QML) workshop provides an introduction to Quantum Machine Learning using PennyLane and PyTorch, with hands-on exercises and take-home challenges. The workshop includes four practical sessions that cover the QML concepts, models, and techniques. The sessions explore development of quantum estimators and classifiers, their training with various optimisers, loss and cost functions, as well as model testing and scoring using variety of metrics. It finally, explains how to create hybrid quantum-classical QML models.
- **Preparation:** Before attempting the workshop, we recommend to do some preparation first:
  - Download all resources (notes, code and data)
  - Install the recommended Python virtual environment (venv + requirements), see "install" folder
  - Undertake some preliminary exercises and get familiar with:
    - PyTorch, tensors, gradients and neural networks:<br>
